# Weather Analytics Dashboard

This project is a Weather Analytics Dashboard built using **React** and **Redux Toolkit**.
The main goal of this project is to show how I handle API data, state management,
routing, and basic data visualization in a real-world frontend scenario.

---

## What this project does

- Shows **current weather** details of a city
- Allows users to **search different cities**
- Supports **multiple cities**
- Shows a **detailed forecast view** when a city is selected
- Displays **hourly temperature trends using a chart**
- Allows users to **add and remove favorite cities**
- Simple and clean UI focused on functionality

---

## Why I built it this way

I focused more on:
- Clear data flow
- Simple and readable code
- Features that can be easily explained

Instead of adding too many advanced features, I made sure that
each core requirement works properly and is easy to understand.

## Tech Stack Used

- **React** (Functional Components & Hooks)
- **Redux Toolkit** (for centralized state management)
